# full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree: Tournament Planner
1. In this project, a Python module was created that uses the PostgreSQL database to keep track of players and matches in a game tournament.

2. The game tournament will used the Swiss system for pairing up players in each round: players are not eliminated, and each player should be paired with another player with the same number of wins, or as close as possible.

3. This project has two parts: defining the database schema (SQL table definitions), and writing the code that will use it.

3. Skills gained: 
  a. to design and implement SQL Database.


# Installation and Running

1. Fork the repository, download. 
2. Download and/or install the Postgresql and bleach Python Libraries.
3. To test the Tournament Functions in the command line naviate to the project directory and run the "Python tournament_test.py ." command from the root directory (with the app.yaml file) in the command line.

## Usage
1. This can now serve as a back end to an application for a Tournament based on the Swiss System for tournaments.
